                    <span class="newthought">I can't really call myself an art person.</span> I love art, but I'm not
                    exactly an educated art consumer.  I love landscapes, though, and I hate hosting my own images. I
                    remember hearing something about the Met supporting an api for its collection and thought "gosh,
                    wouldn't that be neat."

            Said API is documented <a href="https://metmuseum.github.io/">here</a>, and it's pretty full featured.  You
            basically get a bunch of <code>objectID</code> integers that correspond to a query (I haven't played around
            with their query engine too much, although it seems...interestingly structured; hit refresh a few times
            and you'll notice the variety of images that correspond to the query keyword "landscape").

            I have a <code>/random_art</code><label for="random_art" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="random_art" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">
            Check out the <em>automatically generated</em> (thanks FastAPI) documentation over at the <a href="/docs">docs</a>
            page!  Ok, it's not actually that helpful at the moment. Should a website be a crypto api anyway?  Who knows!
        </span>
            endpoint setup on this website, and a messily implemented object that
            does some cache-ing and rate limiting (of sorts).  It's messy because I'm trying to learn about async python
            code and that's been a work in progress. I think I'm going to extend the endpoint to accommodate different
            queries, but probably not just yet.
