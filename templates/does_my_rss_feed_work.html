        Is making an RSS feed as simple as the name suggests? I have a suspicion that feeds update with changes to the preview content...let's see! Narrator: they do, but they don't appear as unread.

            I'm basically just testing to see whether the rss feed I built works...In unrelated news it appears that questions marks aren't allowed in my URLs. Ah, a bug for another day.

            It's another test! Will Ross see this? Who knows!
